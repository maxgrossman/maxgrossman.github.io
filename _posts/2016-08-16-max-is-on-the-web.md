Max is: Tall, surfs, likes J5, and on the web. 

Posts on this site will cover many of things: information about me, projects I'm working on, music, code that may be helpful, and maps...definitely maps. 

Stay tuned and please reach out with questions and suggestions to improve my code - I recognize my newness to coding and the reality that there are probably more efficient answers to the problems I am solivng.
